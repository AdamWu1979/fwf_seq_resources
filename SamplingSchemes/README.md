## Sampling schemes for FWF-related experiments

### Overview
Depending on the analysis method, the experiment must include a set of samples that can be used to estimate a  given set of model parameters. Below is a collection of sampling schemes that have been tailored to a given method and organ. Please consider them staring points for your experiments, as the optimal design of sampling schemes is still an open question.

### Diffusional variance decomposition (DIVIDE) and Q-space trajectory imaging (QTI)
**General principle**  
DIVIDE and QTI both require that at least three unique b-values are sampled, and that at least two shapes of the b-tensor are included (b_{\Delta}^2). QTI also requires 28 non-colinear signal samples.
